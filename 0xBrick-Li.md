After yesterday's heavy rain, today is sunny and the sky is clear. I can see mountains and buildings miles away. I need to print my updated resume in two hours. I have added my internship experience from this summer. In the afternoon, I will participate in the career meeting at our school. But I don’t want to get a traditional job, since it is hard and tiring. I want to seek jobs in Web3. It is fascinating. Oh, this is the first time I am writing about what I want, not because I was pushed, and not in an exam. I hate exams.
