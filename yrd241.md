Read an awesome article "[How to Discover long-tail MEV Strategies using Revm](https://pawelurbanek.com/long-tail-mev-revm)" by [Paweł Urbanek.](https://pawelurbanek.com/) "long-tail" here refers to niche, infrequent, and less obvious profit opportunities in DeFi protocols. Unlike "short-tail" MEV (e.g., common arbitrage between DEXes or liquidations on lending platforms, which are highly competitive and automated), long-tail MEV focuses on unconventional, sporadic strategies that exploit nonobvious transaction details. These might include rare edge cases in protocol interactions, coinbase bribes, or subtle gas price manipulations, often requiring manual analysis rather than bots. The term draws from the "long-tail" concept in economics, where many small, low-volume opportunities aggregate to significant value due to minimal competition.
