Today's topic is about The web3 knowledge you most want to know . You can share the knowledge and try to explain the keywords include RWA Tokenization、AI Token、DePIN、Tokenization of digital assets、Stablecoins， We can exchange our understanding of them and we can discuss What are their characteristics, how are they developing, and what is their current situation.

It refers to the transformation of assets with economic value in the real world (such as real estate, bonds, artworks, equipment, etc.) into tradable digital tokens on the chain through blockchain technology.

Objective: To enhance the liquidity, divisibility and global accessibility of traditional assets, enabling ordinary investors to participate in high-threshold markets as well.

I. The "Breakthrough Logic" of Starbucks RWA: Transforming the coffee Tree into an on-chain asset

一、星巴克 RWA 的 “破局逻辑”：把咖啡树变成链上资产

Starbucks' RWA solution essentially involves "on-chain reconstruction" of its offline physical assets (Brazilian coffee plantations) through technological means. The core steps are broken down as follows:

星巴克的 RWA 方案，本质是将线下实体资产（巴西咖啡园）通过技术手段 “链上重构”，核心步骤拆解如下：

Asset digitalization

资产数字化：

By leveraging satellite remote sensing and blockchain technology, "every coffee tree" in Brazilian coffee plantations is precisely anchored, transforming traditional "fuzzy assets" such as land value, coffee tree growth value, and future earnings into traceable and quantifiable digital certificates on the chain.

借助卫星遥感 + 区块链技术，精准锚定巴西咖啡园的 “每一株咖啡树”，把土地价值、咖啡树生长价值、未来收益等传统 “模糊资产”，转化为链上可追溯、可量化的数字凭证。

Tokenization of equity

权益代币化：

The equity of coffee plantations is proportionally segmented and corresponding tokens are issued.

对咖啡园权益进行 “比例切割”，发行对应代币。

These tokens directly anchor the partial ownership and income rights of coffee trees/coffee plantations, transforming "investing in the coffee industry" from "heavy assets and high thresholds" to "lightweight and inclusive".

这些代币直接锚定咖啡树 / 咖啡园的部分所有权、收益权，让 “投资咖啡产业” 从 “重资产、高门槛” 变成 “轻量级、普惠化”。

Liquidity empowerment

流动性赋能：

The token is listed on decentralized/centralized trading platforms, breaking down geographical and capital barriers, allowing global investors to "buy and sell coffee tree rights with low thresholds".

代币上线去中心化 / 中心化交易平台，打破地域、资金门槛，让全球投资者能 “低门槛买卖咖啡树权益”；

At the same time, dividends are automatically distributed through smart contracts, and the actual income of the coffee garden is fed back to the token holders in real time.

同时通过智能合约自动分红，把咖啡园的实际收益实时反馈给代币持有者。

Ii. The Industrial Value of RWA: A New Paradigm for Activating "Dormant Capital"

二、RWA 的产业价值：激活 “沉睡资本” 的新范式

The Starbucks case is not an isolated one - RWA is becoming a key tool for traditional industries to "revitalize existing assets and broaden financing channels"

星巴克案例并非个例 ——RWA 正在成为传统产业 “盘活存量资产、拓宽融资渠道” 的关键工具：

To enterprises

对企业：

Converting non-standard assets such as "offline real estate and future income rights" into highly liquid on-chain certificates can not only quickly raise funds (like Starbucks' 12 billion US dollars), but also reduce financing costs (smart contracts replace intermediate links).

把 “线下不动产、未来收益权” 等非标资产，转化为高流动性的链上凭证，既能快速募集资金（如星巴克 120 亿美金），又能降低融资成本（智能合约替代中间环节）。

To investors:

对投资者：

Replace "large-scale physical investment" with "small tokens" to enable ordinary people to participate in the income distribution of traditional industries (such as coffee cultivation, real estate, and supply chain), while enjoying the convenience of 24-hour trading and global market circulation.

用 “小额代币” 替代 “大额实体投资”，让普通人也能参与传统产业（如咖啡种植、房地产、供应链）的收益分配，同时享受24 小时交易、全球市场流通的便利。

Iii. The "Technology + Compliance" Dual Engines for the Implementation of RWA

三、RWA 落地的 “技术 + 合规” 双引擎

The core implementation logic of the RWA project can be extended from the Starbucks case:

从星巴克案例可延伸出 RWA 项目的核心落地逻辑：

Technical layer

技术层：

Asset rights confirmation: Satellite remote sensing, Internet of Things and other technologies ensure the authenticity of "offline assets".

资产确权：卫星遥感、物联网等技术确保 “线下资产真实性”；

On-chain mapping: Digital twin of physical rights and interests through NFTS and smart contracts;

链上映射：通过 NFT、智能合约将实体权益 “数字孪生”；

Automated execution: Rules such as dividends and liquidation are written into smart contracts to achieve "trustless automatic execution".

自动化执行：分红、清算等规则写入智能合约，实现 “无信任化自动执行”。

Compliance Layer

合规层：

Build an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) architecture to ensure that on-chain assets are legally bound to offline entities.

搭建 **SPV（特殊目的载体）** 架构，让链上资产与线下实体合规绑定；

At the same time, connect with regulatory sandboxes (such as the Web3 policies of Hong Kong and Dubai) to address the balance between "compliance" and "innovation".

同时对接监管沙盒（如香港、迪拜的 Web3 政策），解决 “合规性” 与 “创新性” 的平衡问题。

## A complete hackathon team usually requires at least:

-   Product Design (PM/ Designer)
    
-   Technology (front-end + back-end + data/hardware)
    
-   Business/Presentation (Marketing + Pitch)
    

The core objective is to create a demo that can "run, watch and speak" within a short period of time.

From my opinion, I'd like to develp TaaS (Trust-as-a-service) with Blockchain Technology. Help people have mutual benefits but have no trust history to cooperate together.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology used to record transactional data securely, transparently, and immutably among network nodes. Each chain consists of a series of “blocks” connected in chronological order, and each block contains multiple transactions along with metadata, ensuring data integrity and traceability.  
This is a rigorous definition from Wikipedia. Don’t worry if it sounds complex—we will explain each concept in detail step by step.

* * *

## Features of Blockchain

### Immutability

Historical information cannot be altered because each block contains the hash (summary) of the previous block, linking them together. If you try to change one historical block, you would need to modify all subsequent blocks.

### Transparency & Anonymity

All information on the blockchain is public and transparent. Anyone can trace through blocks and the chain to view all historical records, including wallet balances. However, no one knows who actually owns the wallet.

### Fast Transactions

Regardless of the transaction amount or your location, once your transaction is packaged into a block, it is automatically completed. Compared to traditional cross-border remittances, this process is much faster and more convenient.

### Decentralization

Blockchain networks are usually distributed globally, and each node stores an identical copy of the blockchain data. No single entity can control all the nodes, which ensures that the blockchain data will always persist.

### True Immutability

Since blockchain networks are globally distributed, it is nearly impossible for one party to control the majority of nodes. Even if some nodes’ data were tampered with, as long as less than 51% of the nodes are affected, the modification would not be recognized.

* * *

## Advantages and Challenges of Decentralization

### Advantages

-   **Minimized Trust**  
    Decentralized networks do not rely on centralized third parties. Transactions and data are secured by consensus algorithms and cryptographic proofs, reducing the “cost of trust.”
    
-   **Censorship Resistance & High Resilience**  
    Data is stored across multiple nodes. This makes it extremely difficult for single points of failure or censorship attacks to completely shut down the network, improving system security and availability.
    
-   **User Self-Management**  
    Users control their assets and data through private keys. Platforms cannot arbitrarily change or freeze accounts, granting individuals greater privacy and ownership.
    
-   **Open Innovation Ecosystem**  
    Blockchain and smart contracts create a decentralized application (DApp) platform where any developer can innovate and receive token incentives, fostering diverse technologies and business models.
    

### Challenges

-   **Scalability Bottlenecks**  
    With a large number of nodes, public blockchains face low consensus efficiency, limited throughput, and high latency. Current projects are optimizing these issues through sharding, Layer 2 solutions, and other technologies.
    
-   **Security and Governance Issues**  
    Although immutability ensures data security, code vulnerabilities or imbalanced governance (e.g., concentrated voting power in DAOs) may still lead to serious losses.
    
-   **User Experience and Costs**  
    Fully decentralized systems are often not user-friendly for beginners. Private key management is complex, transaction fees fluctuate, and there is a trade-off between ease of use and decentralization.
    
-   **Legal and Compliance Risks**  
    Decentralization and anonymity may conflict with current laws. Cross-border regulation and compliance frameworks are not yet fully established, creating uncertainties for both projects and users.
