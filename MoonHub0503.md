## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology used to record transactional data securely, transparently, and immutably among network nodes. Each chain consists of a series of “blocks” connected in chronological order, and each block contains multiple transactions along with metadata, ensuring data integrity and traceability.  
This is a rigorous definition from Wikipedia. Don’t worry if it sounds complex—we will explain each concept in detail step by step.

## Features of Blockchain

### Immutability

Historical information cannot be altered because each block contains the hash (summary) of the previous block, linking them together. If you try to change one historical block, you would need to modify all subsequent blocks.

### Transparency & Anonymity

All information on the blockchain is public and transparent. Anyone can trace through blocks and the chain to view all historical records, including wallet balances. However, no one knows who actually owns the wallet.

### Fast Transactions

Regardless of the transaction amount or your location, once your transaction is packaged into a block, it is automatically completed. Compared to traditional cross-border remittances, this process is much faster and more convenient.

### Decentralization

Blockchain networks are usually distributed globally, and each node stores an identical copy of the blockchain data. No single entity can control all the nodes, which ensures that the blockchain data will always persist.

### True Immutability

Since blockchain networks are globally distributed, it is nearly impossible for one party to control the majority of nodes. Even if some nodes’ data were tampered with, as long as less than 51% of the nodes are affected, the modification would not be recognized.

## Advantages and Challenges of Decentralization

### Advantages

-   **Minimized Trust**  
    Decentralized networks do not rely on centralized third parties. Transactions and data are secured by consensus algorithms and cryptographic proofs, reducing the “cost of trust.”
    
-   **Censorship Resistance & High Resilience**  
    Data is stored across multiple nodes. This makes it extremely difficult for single points of failure or censorship attacks to completely shut down the network, improving system security and availability.
    
-   **User Self-Management**  
    Users control their assets and data through private keys. Platforms cannot arbitrarily change or freeze accounts, granting individuals greater privacy and ownership.
    
-   **Open Innovation Ecosystem**  
    Blockchain and smart contracts create a decentralized application (DApp) platform where any developer can innovate and receive token incentives, fostering diverse technologies and business models.
    

### Challenges

-   **Scalability Bottlenecks**  
    With a large number of nodes, public blockchains face low consensus efficiency, limited throughput, and high latency. Current projects are optimizing these issues through sharding, Layer 2 solutions, and other technologies.
    
-   **Security and Governance Issues**  
    Although immutability ensures data security, code vulnerabilities or imbalanced governance (e.g., concentrated voting power in DAOs) may still lead to serious losses.
    
-   **User Experience and Costs**  
    Fully decentralized systems are often not user-friendly for beginners. Private key management is complex, transaction fees fluctuate, and there is a trade-off between ease of use and decentralization.
    
-   **Legal and Compliance Risks**  
    Decentralization and anonymity may conflict with current laws. Cross-border regulation and compliance frameworks are not yet fully established, creating uncertainties for both projects and users.
