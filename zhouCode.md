每天一个主题，进入主题，学习的意义。

Why learning changes life? Since we were born, we began learning. When I was a baby. I learned to speak, and walk. When I was a student. I learned many subjects. Then I went to work. I learned social rules. But why we must learn in every period in our life? Most people think learning is tormenting. But in my opinion, learning is life. Of course, learning is not just read book. We find our way through learning. We discover the meaning of life by learning. We find the way out of existential crisis. I love learning.

**Why does learning change life?** Since we were born, we have been learning. When I was a baby, I learned to speak and walk. When I was a student, I learned many subjects. Then I went to work and learned social rules. But why must we learn in every period of our life? Most people think learning is a burden, but in my opinion, learning is life. Of course, learning is not just reading books. We find our way through learning. We discover the meaning of life by learning. We find ways to overcome life’s difficulties. I love learning.

Keeping future resources attacked **intact** means keeping present consumption and **in** check. And that’s why we promote green ways of living and working.

intact: If something is _intact,_ it's still in one piece. If you'd like your sand castle to remain _intact_, I suggest you build it away from the water.

promote: If you work for a marketing firm, your job is to _promote_ new products — to publicize them and to try to get the public to buy them.
