stateless ethereum is this big idea to fix a huge problem: the blockchain's data (like everyone's account info) is getting way too big and heavy. It's making it really tough for regular people to run their own full node because they need tons of storage.

So the plan is to change how nodes check transactions. Instead of needing the entire massive state data stored on their own computer, they can just use a little piece of proof that comes with the transaction or block to verify everything is cool. This little proof has all the necessary info and cryptographic stuff to show the transaction is legit.

The main goals are to make running a node way cheaper and easier (so more people can do it), help the network handle more stuff (scale better), and keep things truly decentralize

The answer to that is the CIS role and their mission is separate from the FBI mission. People think the CIAâ€˜s cannot operatet in the United States.The FBI has dominant law [enforcement.Authority.In](http://enforcement.Authority.In) the United States. The mission of the FBI is different from.That of the CIA. The FBI has the law enforcement power.The FBI has the authority to arrest and prosecute and send and put people in jail
