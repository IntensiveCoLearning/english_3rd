I Contunue to learn English about IOS 26

Just finished upgraded about 30 minutes age,So far i'm seeing some lag and phone is getting a little bit warm.

But i assume it's indexing,i know every major IOS update is like this,once it's down indexing it should be fine.

what does indexing mean in this sense?

It means the litearal defintion of the word,The phone is creating a searchable datebase for you various apps and it's all happing in the backgroud whick is why the phone is warm.

I recently picked up a 2020 Intel MacBook Pro (i5 / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD). I know Apple Silicon has been out for a while now, but this deal came up locally and I decided to go for it.

On the plus side, it feels solid, the keyboard is way better than the old butterfly one, and performance so far has been perfectly fine for what I do (mostly browsing, light editing, and some coding).

But I can’t help wondering lol… did I make a smart move or did I mess up? With all the hype around the M1/M2/M3 chips, I’m worried I might regret not waiting or spending a little extra.

For those of you who are still using Intel MacBook Pros in 2025 — how has the experience been long term? Any big downsides I should watch out for? And if you’ve switched from Intel to Apple Silicon, was the difference crazy, or just subtle?
