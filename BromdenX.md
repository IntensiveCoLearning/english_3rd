I Contunue to learn English about IOS 26

Just finished upgraded about 30 minutes age,So far i'm seeing some lag and phone is getting a little bit warm.

But i assume it's indexing,i know every major IOS update is like this,once it's down indexing it should be fine.

what does indexing mean in this sense?

It means the litearal defintion of the word,The phone is creating a searchable datebase for you various apps and it's all happing in the backgroud whick is why the phone is warm.
