Today, I learned 15 new words and reviewed 5 words using the Baicizhan app。

I also hope to set aside some time later to create an English study plan.

Today was a busy day—I was out running around almost the whole time. At noon, I studied some vocabulary and reviewed five words, but then I got interrupted and forgot to finish my study check-in. Just now, I suddenly remembered it… omg.

Today I didn’t do my vocabulary check-in yet, but I’ll make it up later. I spent most of the day in meetings and even had a short conversation in English. Still, I haven’t made a proper study plan. Procrastination strikes again…
