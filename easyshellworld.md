Today, I learned 15 new words and reviewed 5 words using the Baicizhan app。

I also hope to set aside some time later to create an English study plan.

Today was a busy day—I was out running around almost the whole time. At noon, I studied some vocabulary and reviewed five words, but then I got interrupted and forgot to finish my study check-in. Just now, I suddenly remembered it… omg.

Today I didn’t do my vocabulary check-in yet, but I’ll make it up later. I spent most of the day in meetings and even had a short conversation in English. Still, I haven’t made a proper study plan. Procrastination strikes again…

Today I focused on learning two short phrases: **“Good afternoon”** and **“Hello everyone.”**

Imagine this: Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, walks onto the stage and says, **“Good afternoon.”**  
In this version, that formal opening is taken as a **bearish signal** — markets interpret it as the start of a careful, technical, or hawkish message. Traders tighten up, volatility can rise, bond yields may move higher and risky assets can slip, because a formal press-conference tone often precedes precise (and sometimes less-accommodative) policy language.

Now imagine Powell smiles and says, **“Hello everyone.”**  
Here the friendlier opening is treated as a **bullish / reassuring signal** — the tone feels more accessible and calming, which can soothe short-term market nerves and help lift sentiment. Investors may take a conversational, upbeat start as a hint that the remarks will be less technical and more focused on stability or support, which can translate into positive immediate market moves.

Today was another day without studying English. Later, I had a short talk with a foreigner because of some trivial matter. It turned out that he didn’t understand English very well either. My English is poor, so in the end I had no choice but to use a translator to communicate with him. The problem was that the text also included some French, and I couldn’t understand a single word of it. I had to double-check many parts again and again, afraid of any misunderstanding. In the end, it felt like another day of ineffective communication. Have a good dream.

Today was another day I didn't study. Instead, I went with someone to the movies and we watched a classic English film, _Forrest Gump_. The story follows Forrest, a kind but simple man from Alabama, as he moves through several decades of American life. Despite his low IQ, Forrest's honesty and loyalty lead him to surprising places—playing college football, serving in Vietnam, starting a successful shrimp business, and meeting many famous people along the way. The film is both funny and touching, and it shows how small, steady actions can change a life. I may not have opened a book today, but watching the movie still felt like a kind of lesson about kindness, persistence, and accepting whatever life brings.

Today I learned some new words about restaurants in American culture. **Diners** are casual restaurants that serve food all day, often with a focus on "home-style cooking." **Cafeterias** use a self-service model where customers choose their food from a line. **Drive-ins** are part of car culture, allowing people to eat in their vehicles while being served. Finally, **Automats** are restaurants where meals are delivered through machines, offering a unique and automated dining experience.

Today was another day without studying. I spent the whole day in meetings, and by the end, I felt dizzy and exhausted.

Today I didn’t study any new English words again. Instead, I spent some time reading about the U.S. dollar and its history. I recalled President Richard Nixon’s famous speech on August 15, 1971, when he announced that the United States would suspend the dollar’s convertibility into gold. He said this action was meant to “defend the dollar against the speculators” and to protect the American economy.

I also reviewed Paul Volcker’s speeches in the early 1980s, when he was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. At that time, inflation was extremely high, and Volcker emphasized that the central bank must take tough measures. He spoke about reducing the growth of the money supply, raising interest rates, and accepting short-term pain in order to restore long-term stability. His words showed a determination to fight inflation, even if it meant a deep recession.

Today I didn’t really study hard. Instead, I spent most of the time walking outside and enjoying the autumn weather. The air was cool, and the leaves were starting to turn yellow and red. It reminded me that a new season has arrived, bringing both changes and opportunities. Even though I didn’t open my books, I felt that I should plan better for tomorrow and keep learning step by step.

Today I didn’t make much progress in my studies. I spent the afternoon reading some news about technology instead. One article talked about how artificial intelligence is changing the way people work, and another explained the challenges of building clean energy for the future. These topics were interesting, but I still feel guilty for not focusing on my English learning. Maybe tomorrow I can balance both—study some words and still read about the world.
