Today, I learned 15 new words and reviewed 5 words using the Baicizhan app。

I also hope to set aside some time later to create an English study plan.

Today was a busy day—I was out running around almost the whole time. At noon, I studied some vocabulary and reviewed five words, but then I got interrupted and forgot to finish my study check-in. Just now, I suddenly remembered it… omg.

Today I didn’t do my vocabulary check-in yet, but I’ll make it up later. I spent most of the day in meetings and even had a short conversation in English. Still, I haven’t made a proper study plan. Procrastination strikes again…

Today I focused on learning two short phrases: **“Good afternoon”** and **“Hello everyone.”**

Imagine this: Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, walks onto the stage and says, **“Good afternoon.”**  
In this version, that formal opening is taken as a **bearish signal** — markets interpret it as the start of a careful, technical, or hawkish message. Traders tighten up, volatility can rise, bond yields may move higher and risky assets can slip, because a formal press-conference tone often precedes precise (and sometimes less-accommodative) policy language.

Now imagine Powell smiles and says, **“Hello everyone.”**  
Here the friendlier opening is treated as a **bullish / reassuring signal** — the tone feels more accessible and calming, which can soothe short-term market nerves and help lift sentiment. Investors may take a conversational, upbeat start as a hint that the remarks will be less technical and more focused on stability or support, which can translate into positive immediate market moves.

Today was another day without studying English. Later, I had a short talk with a foreigner because of some trivial matter. It turned out that he didn’t understand English very well either. My English is poor, so in the end I had no choice but to use a translator to communicate with him. The problem was that the text also included some French, and I couldn’t understand a single word of it. I had to double-check many parts again and again, afraid of any misunderstanding. In the end, it felt like another day of ineffective communication. Have a good dream.
