I have done some translation work today for the bounty task. (Carry on later) I will find some podcasts about Crypto/Web3 in English on YouTube tomorrow for my listening skills and to broaden my horizons.

Finished the translation work today, [\[link\](https://www.notion.so/DAO-NGO-ESG-26dc87cd64c68021b50bdc0c29282a09?source=copy\_link)](https://www.notion.so/DAO-NGO-ESG-26dc87cd64c68021b50bdc0c29282a09?source=copy_link) Haven't watched the podcast today...I'll try to write and translate some notes tomorrow with some first-handed news.

Today I finished my study for Rustlings and just took some notes for a crypto-related podcast. [Video Link](https://youtu.be/elz6mWy1Jns?si=b4gNvqGioAMSf8kI)

1\. Whether it’s YouTube, X, or other sources of information, there are always three types of players in the crypto market: short-term, medium-term, and long-term. These three groups interpret the same piece of information completely differently. Therefore, before blindly following someone else’s investment advice, first determine what type of investor they are. Generally, long-term investing is relatively the easiest.

2\. The crypto market has its own implicit cycles. You need to understand which phase of the business/economic cycle and credit cycle you are currently in, how liquidity stands, and what the Federal Reserve is doing.

3\. Investing is not a game of predicting the future—it’s about risk management. Even if everything goes ideally as planned, you must still rigorously manage risks to ensure you survive until the end.

4\. You cannot always be right—you will inevitably make foolish mistakes. You will certainly invest in some projects that result in losses; this is entirely normal.

5\. Volatility is the price you pay to make money in the crypto market. The crypto market is extremely unstable. If you’re investing long-term, you must mentally accept that your portfolio will constantly fluctuate up and down.

6\. Most tokens are not viable. A significant portion is outright scams or nonsense, because creating a new coin, writing a whitepaper, and building a fancy website is very easy. For long-term investments, you must conduct extremely careful due diligence: Is there genuinely a strong team building something meaningful?

7\. The best time to buy is often when everyone is saying it’s the worst time. When everyone is hyping a coin to break through some new high, it’s time to sell. Don’t follow the crowd.

8\. Position sizing is critical. Position sizing essentially means limiting yourself to investing only a certain percentage of your total portfolio into any single asset. Ideally, allocate no more than 5% of your total portfolio to any single project—most people use 1% or 2%, and for highly risky projects, 0.5% or even less. The only plausible exception is Bitcoin—some investors allocate 80%, 90%, or even 100% of their portfolio to Bitcoin. For all other tokens, strictly adhere to your self-imposed position-sizing rules.

9\. Everyone is shilling their own bags. All token holders are inherently biased toward their own holdings. Even if a project is fundamentally silly, its holders often believe it has tremendous potential.

10\. There are countless influencers aggressively running pump-and-dump schemes, especially in memecoin spaces—so don’t trust them; they may be orchestrating “pig butchering” scams.

11\. Fully diluted valuation (FDV) is crucial. Market cap determines a project’s scale—not the token price alone. FDV tells you how many tokens are currently circulating versus how many will exist at maximum supply in the future.

12\. Within ten years, the crypto market will become a multi-trillion-dollar market, yet 99.999% of tokens will not survive until then. Only a tiny handful of tokens are suitable for long-term investment; the vast majority should only be traded short-term, requiring entirely different strategies than those used for long-term investing.

I attended the weekly meeting today and pushed myself to do some English speaking, although I'm more like not sure what to say...and attended another meeting about building my own IP on social media, which is a very useful advice and I will try to implement that.
