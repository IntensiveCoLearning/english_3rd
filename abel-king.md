S + V：The simplest pattern, where a subject performs an action or exists in a state.This pattern is the core of concise communication, like a single drumbeat setting the rhythm.

S + V + O：The subject performs an action on a direct object.This pattern adds a target to the action, making sentences more dynamic and complete.

S + V + C：The subject is linked to a complement that describes or identifies it, often using linking verbs like "is," "seems," or "becomes."This pattern defines or describes, giving clarity to states of being.

S + V + IO + DO：The subject performs an action that involves giving or showing something (direct object) to someone (indirect object)。This pattern handles actions involving two objects, like passing gifts, making communication more relational.

S + V + O + OC：The subject acts on an object and adds a complement to describe or rename it.This pattern adds depth by describing or redefining the object, completing the action’s impact.
