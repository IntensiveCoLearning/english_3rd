## Self-introduction

I am a non-native english speaker and also not a mandarin speaker. I come here to further strengthen my english, but at the some time maybe learn a bit of mandarin through the conversation/discussion.

I looked up at Bruce's check in note and I think I will do the same. I will list down things I will use for reading/listening during Intensive Co-Learning. I'll be focusing on either Rust development or Marathon stuff
