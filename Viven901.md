Today was the first day of the English Intensive co-learning.

Overall, it felt a bit chaotic because I haven’t set a clear daily study plan or learning goals yet. For now, I’ll just focus on studying grammar today.

Today I studied four parts of grammar. It wasn’t too difficult, but I still need to review more.

I started trying to listen to podcasts since last night. Listening comprehension is really challenging for me. Today, I practiced seven sentences on Daily English Dactation, repeated them aloud, and memorized them. I’ll review them again tomorrow and organize everything in note form.

Today’s reflection: Listening is a major difficulty for me, and I need to practice daily.

During today's weekly meeting, I was driving, having just left my previous company, on my way home.

My emotions were quite complex. Even though it's been over a year since I left that company, every time I hear some news from there, my heart still feels stirred.

I dislike this part of myself. Since I’ve already moved on, the people and matters there should have nothing to do with me anymore. Why do they still affect me deep down?

Perhaps it’s because I invested so much there—it’s like the story of the Little Prince and his rose...

But now, I’ve found new goals for myself. It’s time to move forward, with absolute determination. I will only get better from here on out!

When I was little, there was a pomegranate tree in our yard. Every year, just before the Mid-Autumn Festival, it would be laden with fruit.

But in my memory, it seems I wasn't very interested in pomegranates from a young age. They were troublesome to peel, you had to spit out the seeds, and sometimes the juice would accidentally stain your clothes, leaving marks that were hard to wash out...

As I grew up, I almost never ate pomegranates again. Work kept getting busier, and I certainly wasn't going to eat such a "troublesome" food.

Yesterday, a friend came to visit. While I was at the supermarket buying ginger, I suddenly saw pomegranates. I remembered that my friend liked them, so I bought three.

This afternoon, feeling a bit bored and craving a snack, I thought of the pomegranates I bought yesterday. They really are a kind of food that "helps pass the time"...

Wow, it was such a pleasant surprise! The skin was thin, the arils were plump and juicy, and the seeds were small and soft...

So today, I spent an hour eating a whole pomegranate...

While peeling and eating it, I felt the passage of time, I reconnected with this food I had "abandoned" for so long, and I felt the beauty of life...

I'm delighted by my current sensitivity to my own emotions and to the subtle details of life. I'm no longer the numb person I used to be. Now I feel vibrant and full of love for life. It feels so good.

"On a cloudy day, in a room with the lights off, all my thoughts gradually settle, little by little..."

There's a chill in the air today, and it has been drizzling all day long. As the saying goes, each autumn rain brings a new level of cold—the breath of autumn is truly palpable.

Suddenly, the blazing summer is gone, and deep autumn is already here.

My thoughts slowly spread like the misty rain outside. I have no mind for concrete tasks, only wanting to daydream, let my mind wander, and savor this moment of inner peace.

Complex and intertwined, there is both calm and uncertainty. I just hope that my work situation can be settled as soon as possible.

A lot of things are like traveling, and when you decide to go, the hardest part is already done .

But the reality is that many people like to stop and watch, so along the way, there are not many people on the journey, and even fewer people are willing to climb to the top.

Every day something different will happen, rub shoulders with different people, and what you have to do is allow everything to happen, and then accept it with peace of mind, and your life will develop step by step in a better direction.

When faced with life’s choices, it is important to listen to your inner voice. Don’t be swayed by external opinions; only you truly know what is most important to you.

Courageously follow your heart, and even if the path seems filled with challenges, trust in your choice. The path that truly belongs to you is one that only you can walk with strength and conviction.

At the same time, we must understand that there is no absolute right or wrong in choices. Every decision brings different experiences and lessons, and these experiences will ultimately become valuable assets in our lives. No matter which path we choose, as long as we face it bravely and persist in walking forward, we will eventually achieve our own success and

I gradually understood why I was not happy, because I always expected a result.

Reading a book and expecting it to make me deep, eating and swimming expecting it to make me lose a jin, sending a text message expecting it to be answered, expecting it to respond to good people, writing a story about a mood expecting it to be paid attention to Consolation, attending an event looks forward to a fulfilling and enriching experience.

If these preset expectations come true, breathe a sigh of relief. What if it doesn't happen? Self-pity.

But it was the same me when I was a child. I spent an afternoon watching the ants move and waiting for the stones to bloom. When I was a child, I didn' t expect the result.

No matter what you are going through, good or bad, life will continueto move forward.

Sometimes hurt and failure is not necessarily a bad thing, it will make you better,so is loneliness and loss. Everything will turn out to be a good thing in the end, as long as you can go to the end.

Before a certain age, you can rely on overdraft body, small cleverness and God to give you the luck to live all the time. However,after a certain age, what can really make you go far is self-discipline positivity and diligence.

Life is not always as people wish, there is notso much in this world just right, perhaps hard work may not berewarded, but the process ofhard work will certainly make you a better self, we are in this world, what we choose is what we save, the richness of life depends on ourselves, just as what you pay at this moment determines what kind of person you will become in the future.When you can't change the world, you can change yourself.

Many times, we are unhappy because we cannot live in the present, pretend to have too many things on our minds, either worry about the future or regret the past, and many troubles are caused by thinking too much and doing too little.

There is no right choice in this world, but we have done our best to make the original choice right. The real aging of people begins with"appointment".

My favorite attitude towards life is"don't be afraid in the first half of your life, don't regret it in the second half of your life".

Although the road is far, the line will come.

Although things are difficult, do can be a small step or even thousands of miles, not a small stream into a long river, there will be a turn.

Bitter aftertaste, there will be back to the world events, will be done in the fine.

The world is difficult, will become easy not through a cold to the bone, how to get the fragrance of plum blossom.

You need to know that all counterattacks are prepared; all lights need time to be seen; all luck is the foreshadowing of efforts.

You always say your dreams are out of reach, but you never get up early. Thinking too much is all questions, working to hard is all answers, you envy other people's lives, but you haven't survived other people's hardships, halfway up the mountain is too crowded, don't you want to go to the top of the mountain?

Who does not have a process of hard work, life ups and downs, inevitably some setbacks, but that is not the reason for our fall. When our parents carry the burden for us, we are not qualified to take a step back. Your intermittent efforts and the days you muddle through are the zero of your previous efforts.

No matter how hard it is, don't give up! Come on!

Like a word called no break, no stand, some things must be destroyed in order to usher in a new life.

Whether it's the people who consume youthe things that make you afraid and anxious, or the lazy and fragile you in the past, you must let them "die" so that you can break the cycle and be reborn.

Everyone is afraid of change and fear of the unknown but change means new opportunities and light.

Examine the past review and summarize, learn from the bitter experience, destroy and reshape, Nirvana rebirth!

This is the awakening, although the process is painful, but it is also the only way for you to change Big waves wash the sand, eliminating the false and retaining the true. Brave people can usher in a better life.

Don't worry too much about things that haven't happened yet.

Your cranky thoughts and worries will only make you feel powerless and sad by constantly competing with yourself.

What you should do is to calm down,start with small things like having a good meal, and do every little thing around you well, like catching fireflies one after another from the forest, and finally the light that blooms in the bottle is your own medal of honor.

Nothing that is truly valuable can be accomplished easily and comfortably. The silence in the morning, the sleepless starlight, the sober restraint, the persistence of fighting alone, and the promises made secretly are the moments when I love myself.

Life is about upgrading and fighting monsters step by step, keep at it, and your persistent efforts wil definitely pay off.
