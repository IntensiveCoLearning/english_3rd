4\. **This is why you see \[it/something\] as so \[adjective\].**

    ◦ **Function:** To explain the reason or cause behind a particular observation or widespread phenomenon.

## Chunks

1\. **in love with**: 表达强烈喜欢时

2\. **big business**: This is a useful collocation referring to an industry or activity that is very profitable or involves a lot of money. Snacking is described as "**big business**, with an estimated $1.5 trillion a year spent globally".

4\. **turn to**: This phrasal verb means to resort to, depend on, or use something for support or a particular purpose. Christine Cochran notes that if "money is tight, this is something that you can **turn to**".

7\. **pay for the basics**: This chunk refers to having just enough money to cover essential living expenses. It's implied by the definition of "money is tight" where there's "only just enough money available to **pay for the basics** needed to live".

8\. **target a specific function**: This collocation describes the design and marketing strategy for some modern snacks, which are created to provide particular benefits. "Many modern snacks **target a specific function**".

10\. **head over to**: This phrasal verb means to go to a particular place. Learners are encouraged to "**head over to** our website" for further resources.

## Vocabulary

1\. **Confectionery**: This refers to **sweets, chocolates, and other sweet foods**. It's a topic-specific term for a category of snacks, often considered more formal than just "sweets".

2\. **Savoury**: An adjective used to describe food that is **salty or spicy and not sweet**. It's crucial for distinguishing food tastes, as opposed to sweet items like confectionery.

5\. **Nibble on**: A phrasal verb meaning to **take small bites of food**. It's topic-specific to eating and describes a particular way of consuming snacks, as mentioned by Beth: "whatever you like to nibble on".

7\. **Functional ingredients**: A phrase referring to **components in food that offer specific health benefits beyond basic nutrition**. This is topic-specific to health and food science, and slightly higher difficulty due to its technical nature, as consumers look for snacks with specific functional ingredients for things like gut health or muscle development.

8\. **Proper meal**: A phrase referring to **a full, substantial meal, typically eaten sitting down**. This is topic-specific to food and meal routines, indicating a shift from traditional dining habits due to snacks.

9\. **Indulge in**: A verb meaning to **allow oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something, often to excess**. While high-frequency, it carries a nuance of pleasure or occasional overconsumption, as Britons "indulge in" confectionery and chocolate weekly.

10\. **Modern twist**: A phrase referring to **a new or different version of something traditional**. This is a useful, general phrase that can describe adaptations, such as modern baked snacks being a "modern twist" on traditional cheese bread.

## Required Expressions

-   **hits the spot (idiom)**: This means something **is exactly what you want or need**. For example, Annie Gray finds that salted peanuts and a banana together "hit the spot" for her.
    
-   **money is tight**: This phrase describes a situation where **there is only just enough money available to pay for the basics needed to live**. Snacks which are cheap enough will sell even if money is tight.
    
-   **on the go (idiom)**: This means doing things **while busy travelling or moving around, rather than at home**. Consumers are often eating on the go because they cannot always sit down for three meals a day.
    
-   **mental clarity**: This term describes a **state in which your mind is fully focused, active and engaged, not dull or foggy**. Some modern snacks claim to improve mental clarity.
    
-   **swim against the current/tide (idiom)**: This means to **do or say things which are different from most other people, because you do not mind being different**. Barbara Oievari mentions she "can't swim against the current" when her son prefers packaged snacks over natural ones

今天看了20分钟讲座《Magic and Demonology in Ancient Egypt》

发现这类正式场合演讲的特点在于用词规整，比如通常用动词直接表达一个动作，而不使用一个informal的短语，而后者在非正式场合出现的频率更大，常常造成理解上的困难，不过使用这些词的时候还是需要考虑场合，对着普通人讲recrudesce反倒会制造交流上的麻烦。

难点就在于句式结构更为复杂，也使用更多的非日常、但是该领域却很常用的专业术语，给我的启发是可以更针对性地对某一领域或者某一场景集中学习，而不是宽泛地吸收，既有利于听力时进行潜意识预测用词，也有利于在讲话时迅速调动。

这个演讲的教授并非以英语作为第一语言，因此在听力上也造成了难点。

首先是她特定的发音，这和经常作为听力材料的美音英音非常不同，但对我其实是更常出现的情况。这些“口音”其实在发音上往往具有共性，所以能够在听一段时间后，以及在对语境、话题领域熟悉的情况下，迅速进行理解。

更为困难的其实是非母语人的重音、停顿和fillers。非母语人在单词发音以及讲话时，会出现截然不同的重音位置，也经常将单词、句子在意想不到的地方截断，截断时可能伴有不同发音的“呃”类似填充词，因此在脑子里理解的时候往往需要更费功夫地将句子组装起来，因此造成跟不上。我目前没有找到很好的应对方法，倒是让我发现了我自己讲话也会在句子中不恰当的地方截断。

但非母语人通常用词和语法更为简单，学习他们怎样使用简单的词汇去流畅表达出一个精确、完整的意思，感觉是更高效的学习思路。

记录一些很有意思的单词：

-   deity n. 神 可以用复数
    
-   amulet n. 护身符，驱邪物
    
-   nether 在下的，下面的 netherworld 死后的世界（阴间，但非贬义）
    
-   apotro’paic adj. 驱邪的
