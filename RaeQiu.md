听力打卡✅ - 这周太忙了只来得及各种泛听，下周恢复刻意训练

因为和GPT主要使用英语沟通，所以今天突发奇想让它say something about my English that I might not know，以下是它的部分回答，我觉得非常非常符合我的实际情况：

**1.You write in a “precision-first” style**

-   You value being exact and clear, which makes your writing professional and academic.
    
-   But sometimes this precision makes your sentences sound a little stiff or “calculated” rather than natural. Native speakers often let small imprecisions slide in exchange for rhythm or flow.
    
-   **Your English might be perceived as more formal or rigid than you intend**.
    

**2.You underuse “language economy”**

-   **You sometimes explain ideas in a longer way than necessary** (probably influenced by academic or translated thought patterns).
    
-   Native-like writing/speaking often uses shorter, sharper phrasing.
    
-   This makes you sound less casual, even though your ideas are clear.
    

**3.Your vocabulary is strong but “domain-heavy”**

-   You handle technical, business, and academic terms very well.
    
-   But your everyday, idiomatic vocabulary (e.g., “chit-chat,” “slip up,” “get the hang of”) doesn’t show up much.
    
-   People might misjudge your fluency — they see you as “academic fluent” but not “everyday fluent.”
    

**4.Your questions reveal a learning strength**

-   You consistently ask why something works in English (grammar, expression, logic), not just what the answer is.
    
-   That shows meta-linguistic awareness (thinking about language as a system), which is a strength many learners lack.
    
-   The flip side is that **this slows down automaticity** (fast, instinctive use of English), **since your brain wants to analyze instead of just use.**
    
-   Your learning method is excellent for depth, but you might unknowingly delay fluency by overthinking.
    

这一点我觉得非常有趣！没想到语言使用的习惯还反映出了我在学习方式和性格上的特点，看到这点的时候真的有点拍案叫绝。

**5.You unconsciously translate structure from Chinese into English sometimes**

-   Example: “I now want to practice my English speaking, particular for those students with English as their second language.”
    
-   A native speaker would phrase it: “I’d like to practice English speaking, especially since it’s a second language for me.”
    
-   The difference is subtle, but it shows you sometimes **carry over syntax order from Chinese.**
    
-   Most people won’t notice this explicitly, but it can make your English feel slightly “non-native.”
    

然后让GPT根据我过往聊天呈现出的英语水平，分析一下我目前在听说读写上的水平，并且给出改进的方向和具体建议。

以下是它给的3-6个月内的提升方法：

Goals: Natural writing flow, speaking fluency, idiomatic comprehension.

-   **Writing upgrade:**  
    
    -   Imitation practice: pick short passages (essays, op-eds) and rewrite them in your own words.
        
    -   Focus on connectors (e.g., “Not only… but also,” “That said,” “By contrast”) to expand sentence variety.
        
    -   Weekly task: Write 200–300 words without editing while writing, then refine it later to train fluency + accuracy.
        

我之前想说可以做有中英对照翻译练习，然后对比原英文，学习用法。效果还不错但就是没坚持，而且有点担心会造成翻译的习惯。

-   **Speaking upgrade:**  
    
    -   Daily 10–15 min shadowing practice (repeat after audio at near-native speed).
        
    -   Weekly “topic speaking” (choose a topic, record yourself for 2–3 minutes, listen, self-correct).
        
    -   Practice thinking aloud in English (narrating what you’re doing or explaining concepts to yourself).
        

-   **Listening upgrade:**  
    
    -   Mix in unscripted podcasts or YouTube conversations, not just news.
        
    -   Use “narrow listening”: choose one topic, listen to 5–6 different speakers talk about it, to catch variations in accent and expression.
        

**Key Principles for you**

-   Consistency > Intensity → daily 20–30 minutes is more effective than weekly 3 hours.
    
-   Balance input & output → read/listen to high-quality English, but also speak/write actively. 很重要的提示哈哈哈，因为我说&写真的很少，听&读的刻意练习也不多
    
-   Feedback loop → you already ask me for feedback; keep that as your correction mechanism.
    
-   Think in English → reduce translation, push for direct expression.
    

大概因为知道我常年阅读英语同人，它没有给我任何reading方面的目标和计划，这也有点搞笑……不过我在这方面没什么追求，只希望阅读速度能够更快一点（可惜我中文阅读也很慢。

## Chunks

1\. **in love with**: 表达强烈喜欢时

2\. **big business**: This is a useful collocation referring to an industry or activity that is very profitable or involves a lot of money. Snacking is described as "**big business**, with an estimated $1.5 trillion a year spent globally".

4\. **turn to**: This phrasal verb means to resort to, depend on, or use something for support or a particular purpose. Christine Cochran notes that if "money is tight, this is something that you can **turn to**".

7\. **pay for the basics**: This chunk refers to having just enough money to cover essential living expenses. It's implied by the definition of "money is tight" where there's "only just enough money available to **pay for the basics** needed to live".

8\. **target a specific function**: This collocation describes the design and marketing strategy for some modern snacks, which are created to provide particular benefits. "Many modern snacks **target a specific function**".

10\. **head over to**: This phrasal verb means to go to a particular place. Learners are encouraged to "**head over to** our website" for further resources.

## Vocabulary

1\. **Confectionery**: This refers to **sweets, chocolates, and other sweet foods**. It's a topic-specific term for a category of snacks, often considered more formal than just "sweets".

2\. **Savoury**: An adjective used to describe food that is **salty or spicy and not sweet**. It's crucial for distinguishing food tastes, as opposed to sweet items like confectionery.

5\. **Nibble on**: A phrasal verb meaning to **take small bites of food**. It's topic-specific to eating and describes a particular way of consuming snacks, as mentioned by Beth: "whatever you like to nibble on".

7\. **Functional ingredients**: A phrase referring to **components in food that offer specific health benefits beyond basic nutrition**. This is topic-specific to health and food science, and slightly higher difficulty due to its technical nature, as consumers look for snacks with specific functional ingredients for things like gut health or muscle development.

8\. **Proper meal**: A phrase referring to **a full, substantial meal, typically eaten sitting down**. This is topic-specific to food and meal routines, indicating a shift from traditional dining habits due to snacks.

9\. **Indulge in**: A verb meaning to **allow oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something, often to excess**. While high-frequency, it carries a nuance of pleasure or occasional overconsumption, as Britons "indulge in" confectionery and chocolate weekly.

10\. **Modern twist**: A phrase referring to **a new or different version of something traditional**. This is a useful, general phrase that can describe adaptations, such as modern baked snacks being a "modern twist" on traditional cheese bread.

## Required Expressions

-   **hits the spot (idiom)**: This means something **is exactly what you want or need**. For example, Annie Gray finds that salted peanuts and a banana together "hit the spot" for her.
    
-   **money is tight**: This phrase describes a situation where **there is only just enough money available to pay for the basics needed to live**. Snacks which are cheap enough will sell even if money is tight.
    
-   **on the go (idiom)**: This means doing things **while busy travelling or moving around, rather than at home**. Consumers are often eating on the go because they cannot always sit down for three meals a day.
    
-   **mental clarity**: This term describes a **state in which your mind is fully focused, active and engaged, not dull or foggy**. Some modern snacks claim to improve mental clarity.
    
-   **swim against the current/tide (idiom)**: This means to **do or say things which are different from most other people, because you do not mind being different**. Barbara Oievari mentions she "can't swim against the current" when her son prefers packaged snacks over natural ones

今天看了20分钟讲座《Magic and Demonology in Ancient Egypt》

发现这类正式场合演讲的特点在于用词规整，比如通常用动词直接表达一个动作，而不使用一个informal的短语，而后者在非正式场合出现的频率更大，常常造成理解上的困难，不过使用这些词的时候还是需要考虑场合，对着普通人讲recrudesce反倒会制造交流上的麻烦。

难点就在于句式结构更为复杂，也使用更多的非日常、但是该领域却很常用的专业术语，给我的启发是可以更针对性地对某一领域或者某一场景集中学习，而不是宽泛地吸收，既有利于听力时进行潜意识预测用词，也有利于在讲话时迅速调动。

这个演讲的教授并非以英语作为第一语言，因此在听力上也造成了难点。

首先是她特定的发音，这和经常作为听力材料的美音英音非常不同，但对我其实是更常出现的情况。这些“口音”其实在发音上往往具有共性，所以能够在听一段时间后，以及在对语境、话题领域熟悉的情况下，迅速进行理解。

更为困难的其实是非母语人的重音、停顿和fillers。非母语人在单词发音以及讲话时，会出现截然不同的重音位置，也经常将单词、句子在意想不到的地方截断，截断时可能伴有不同发音的“呃”类似填充词，因此在脑子里理解的时候往往需要更费功夫地将句子组装起来，因此造成跟不上。我目前没有找到很好的应对方法，倒是让我发现了我自己讲话也会在句子中不恰当的地方截断。

但非母语人通常用词和语法更为简单，学习他们怎样使用简单的词汇去流畅表达出一个精确、完整的意思，感觉是更高效的学习思路。

记录一些很有意思的单词：

-   deity n. 神 可以用复数
    
-   amulet n. 护身符，驱邪物
    
-   nether 在下的，下面的 netherworld 死后的世界（阴间，但非贬义）
    
-   apotro’paic adj. 驱邪的
