The first day of co learning.

-   I downloaded the anki and imported a deck.
    
-   I prepared a speech for the meeting,but unfortunately,I had a scheduling conflict with a class and couldn't attend.I'm very sorry to have missed the first session.
    
-   I am practicing using English to express and record my thoughts.I will keep it up.

The diary of the second day.

-   Today I downloaded hellotalk,an app which provides a platform for communicating with others in English.I find that many times I don't know how to express myself accurately when communicating with others.
    
-   I will continue to use Anki to learn English words.
    
-   I plan to learn listening skills tomorrow.
