The first day of co learning.

-   I downloaded the anki and imported a deck.
    
-   I prepared a speech for the meeting,but unfortunately,I had a scheduling conflict with a class and couldn't attend.I'm very sorry to have missed the first session.
    
-   I am practicing using English to express and record my thoughts.I will keep it up.
