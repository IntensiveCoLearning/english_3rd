Today still listen half an hour English Listening Practice,and keep write it down what have i listen. After this i will listen it twice to correct some mistake and what i didn't hear. yeap,i really think it's just the second day, up to 40% i can't hear clearly and i don't konw what does they mean. Also,those 连读 are very difficult for me， may be is just haven't listening English for a long time.  
just keep going,it is just the beginning.  
And i also listened a podcast on YouTube，here is the link --[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLEsrMms6mw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLEsrMms6mw). About household vocabulary used in daily life.

Today was also a super fulfilling day. This morning,i came accross a vedio on Bilibili about how to learning English thinking and speaking fluent oral English with 300 core words.I think it's a pretty good vedio,may be just for me.Moreover,the speaking speed in the vedio is not very fast,whick is very suitable for beginners like me and enables me to understand what he is saying.The key of this vedio is not to remember more new words,but not to learn how to make efficient use of the vocabulary you already have and speak bravely.

Dictation check in：  
Success in life  
Success means different things for different people. Some may equate it with fame, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments. For me, it means fulfilling one’s dreams. Whatever your dreams are, you have a goal there and then focus all your attention on it. Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal. There are several keys to success. First, your goal must be practical and practicable. If you set your goal too high, chances are that you will never attain it. Next, you have to make a plan of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it. Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligent, patient and persevering. Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them.

The co-learning of the first week has ended, and an executive meeting was held tonight as well. Basically, it's just a summary, regarding the learning this week. First, I'd like to share a video about how to develop an English mindset for guys. I think it's quite useful. And I also made some changes to my study methods. Instead of memorizing more new words, I focus on accumulating knowledge through practice. Now, every day I listen to a podcast and will listen to it two or three times until I can understand its content. Then I will also set some topics for myself, such as orally presenting answers like in an IELTS exam, and I can also correct my pronunciation by recording.

I really, really want to simply jot down today's events. Yes, I have ten wonderful friends. We met in high school and have been together for eight years now. Today, it's rare that all of us are gathered together to celebrate the move-in of our good friends' new home. Everyone is very happy. After all, the last time we all gathered together was in 2021, and four years have passed already.

After graduation, we each went our separate ways on the paths of life and work. The chances to gather together became fewer and fewer. Most of the time, we would be short of one or two people. Even though we don't see each other as often as in school days and our communication is not as frequent as before, our relationship has never become estranged. Every time we meet, it's still a familiar atmosphere, and there are endless topics to talk about, allowing us to express ourselves freely. 

Our activities are always very simple: having meals, drinking milk tea, playing mahjong... But precisely these ordinary and trivial moments make everyone truly happy. Being with them, I also feel extremely happy and relaxed. Truly, I'm very fortunate to have met this group of friends, and I also cherish this friendship very much.

Today I flashed to Guangxi and came to my grandmother's house. It's been almost a year since I last visited, and it's really beautiful here in October. Every time I come here at this time, as soon as I open the door, I see a green field, which is super comfortable.

This year's National Day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, and my grandmother also celebrated her 88th birthday. I hope her old man can be in good health and happy everyday.
