Today’s Focus: Vocabulary Building & Grammar Practice

Morning Session (8:00 AM – 9:30 AM):

I started my day by reviewing 20 new vocabulary words from the IELTS Word List. Words like meticulous (very careful), ephemeral (short-lived), and resilient (able to recover quickly) challenged me. I created flashcards using Anki and practiced pronunciation with Forvo. Later, I wrote five sentences using these words. One example: "Despite the ephemeral nature of cherry blossoms, their beauty inspires resilient efforts to preserve them."

Afternoon Break (12:30 PM – 1:00 PM):

I listened to an English podcast about climate change (TED Talks Daily ). The speaker used complex terms like carbon footprint and sustainable development. I paused to jot down key phrases and later looked up their definitions. This improved my listening comprehension and expanded my topic-specific vocabulary.

Evening Practice (7:00 PM – 8:30 PM):

I focused on grammar—specifically, the difference between present perfect continuous and past perfect. Example sentences:

"I have been studying English for three years." (ongoing action)

"By 2020, she had completed her degree." (action finished before a past time)

I also practiced writing a short paragraph using both tenses:

"Last week, I have been preparing for a job interview. Although I had practiced answering common questions, I still felt nervous. However, the interview went smoothly, and I received positive feedback."

Reflection:

Successes: Mastered 15/20 new words; improved sentence structuring.

Challenges: Confused resilient with resistant initially.

Action Plan: Watch a YouTube video on synonyms tomorrow to avoid such errors.

Quote of the Day:

"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." – Ludwig Wittgenstein

Formatting Tips Applied:

Date/Weather: Standardized format (Day, Month Date, Year; Weather adjective) .

Structure: Divided into sections for clarity (Morning/Afternoon/Evening).

Grammar Focus: Highlighted tense usage with examples .

Reflection: Summarized progress and goals, fostering self-awareness .

This journal balances learning objectives with personal reflection, aligning with effective language acquisition strategies

I. Core Concepts

Formal vs. Informal Language

Formal writing avoids contractions (e.g., "do not" instead of "don't") and uses passive voice for objectivity. For example:

"The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions."

Informal language employs contractions and phrasal verbs, such as:

"Let's grab a coffee and chat about the project."

Cohesion Strategies

Use linking words to connect ideas:

Addition: Furthermore, Moreover

Contrast: However, On the other hand

Cause-effect: Therefore, Consequently

Reference words like pronouns (this, these) help avoid repetition.

II. Vocabulary Building

New Words

Ambiguous: Open to multiple interpretations.

Example: "The instructions were ambiguous, causing confusion."

Scrutinize: To examine carefully.

Example: "The lawyer scrutinized the contract for loopholes."

Feasible: Possible to achieve.

Example: "Solar energy is a feasible solution for rural areas."

Synonyms & Antonyms

Synonyms for significant: Crucial, pivotal, momentous

Antonyms for efficient: Ineffective, sluggish

III. Grammar Focus

Subjunctive Mood

Used for hypothetical situations:

"If I were you, I would reconsider the offer."

Parallel Structure

Maintain consistency in sentence elements:

Correct: "She enjoys hiking, reading, and painting."

Incorrect: "She enjoys hiking, to read, and paints."

IV. Reading Comprehension

Text Analysis:

"The rapid urbanization of developing nations has led to deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Conservationists argue that sustainable planning is imperative to mitigate biodiversity loss."

Main Idea: Urban growth threatens ecosystems.

Author’s Tone: Concerned/Advocative.

Key Terms:

Mitigate: Reduce the severity of.

Fragmentation: Division into disconnected parts.

V. Practical Application

Writing Exercise:

Topic: "Discuss the impact of social media on interpersonal communication."

Structure:

Introduction (Hook + Thesis)

Body Paragraphs (Pros: Connectivity; Cons: Superficial interactions)

Conclusion (Restate thesis + Call to action)

Revision Checklist:

Ensure topic sentences align with the thesis.

Replace vague terms (e.g., "good") with specifics ("efficient," "insightful").

VI. Resources

Grammar Guide: Purdue OWL (Formal writing rules)

Vocabulary Lists: Academic Word List (AWL)

Practice Exercises: Grammarly Blog

Reflection:

Strengths: Improved grasp of subjunctive mood; expanded academic vocabulary.

Areas to Improve: Integrating multiple sources in essays; avoiding redundancy.

Next Steps:

Draft a 300-word essay on today’s topic.

Review 10 academic papers for cohesive devices.

Formatting Notes:

Headings and bullet points enhance readability.

Examples are integrated directly into explanations for clarity.

Key terms are bolded to emphasize importance.

This structure balances theoretical knowledge with practical exercises, aligning with strategies for effective language acquisition
