Today’s Focus: Vocabulary Building & Grammar Practice

Morning Session (8:00 AM – 9:30 AM):

I started my day by reviewing 20 new vocabulary words from the IELTS Word List. Words like meticulous (very careful), ephemeral (short-lived), and resilient (able to recover quickly) challenged me. I created flashcards using Anki and practiced pronunciation with Forvo. Later, I wrote five sentences using these words. One example: "Despite the ephemeral nature of cherry blossoms, their beauty inspires resilient efforts to preserve them."

Afternoon Break (12:30 PM – 1:00 PM):

I listened to an English podcast about climate change (TED Talks Daily ). The speaker used complex terms like carbon footprint and sustainable development. I paused to jot down key phrases and later looked up their definitions. This improved my listening comprehension and expanded my topic-specific vocabulary.

Evening Practice (7:00 PM – 8:30 PM):

I focused on grammar—specifically, the difference between present perfect continuous and past perfect. Example sentences:

"I have been studying English for three years." (ongoing action)

"By 2020, she had completed her degree." (action finished before a past time)

I also practiced writing a short paragraph using both tenses:

"Last week, I have been preparing for a job interview. Although I had practiced answering common questions, I still felt nervous. However, the interview went smoothly, and I received positive feedback."

Reflection:

Successes: Mastered 15/20 new words; improved sentence structuring.

Challenges: Confused resilient with resistant initially.

Action Plan: Watch a YouTube video on synonyms tomorrow to avoid such errors.

Quote of the Day:

"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." – Ludwig Wittgenstein

Formatting Tips Applied:

Date/Weather: Standardized format (Day, Month Date, Year; Weather adjective) .

Structure: Divided into sections for clarity (Morning/Afternoon/Evening).

Grammar Focus: Highlighted tense usage with examples .

Reflection: Summarized progress and goals, fostering self-awareness .

This journal balances learning objectives with personal reflection, aligning with effective language acquisition strategies
