Today I attended the Casual Conversation with Tim which is one of conversation clubs in the English Club discord channel. The host Tim is a native English speaker from UK. I think the casual conversation event is helpful for our learners to practice conversational English without pressure.

Today I joined the Jame's conversation class in the English Hub Discord channel. I learned about the possible replies of the others asking "how are you?". Besides, I knew that the importance of active listening when people have a conversation.
