I will try to record my daily study records in English
In the warm-up meeting, many people shared their own ways of learning English. This is a great start. The goal is to be able to communicate confidently in English after 21 days.

Today, I practiced my English in two ways.

-   **Speaking Practice**: I had a speaking session with Gemini about the topic of my hackathon project. I encountered some issues where my mispronunciations led to misunderstandings, and I had to repeatedly correct myself.
    
-   **Listening Practice**: I listened to a podcast about Ethereum's public goods infrastructure.

I am searching for information on ZK Rollups today to confirm that generalized ZK Rollups are now available. Because I read a point that said general-purpose ZK Rollups haven't been achieved yet.

It is no longer true today. The technology has matured, and the vision of general-purpose ZK Rollups powered by zkEVMs is now a reality.

-   **Listening:** Listened to Fed Chair Powell’s speech at midnight. His familiar “Good afternoon” caused minor market fluctuations. Powell’s neutral tone avoided dovish or hawkish signals, emphasizing balanced monetary policy.
    
-   **Reading:** Studied IPFS and Arweave documentation for a hackathon project. Learned key terms like “content addressing” (IPFS) and “permaweb” (Arweave) for decentralized storage integration.

I was just looking at Naval's Twitter today and realized I had missed a great tweet.

I plan to read some books I've missed before bed.

Today, I completed a casual chat with Gemini. We talked about what makes a game great. In my opinion, it all comes down to the player. If a game can truly resonate with them, it's an excellent piece of work. If it doesn't quite get there, it's still a decent game.

Today I tried another way to chat with Gemini, and so far the experience has been good.

I found a great YouTube channel, "Young Suck Cooking"! Their newest video shows you how to make incredibly crispy fries using an air fryer.For my recent weight loss diet, potatoes have been my main food.

It's been a terrible day. Yesterday, I forgot to clock in and wasted a whole afternoon fixing the water heater. Today, no shops are open because of the weather, and I've been eating vegetarian all day—I'm about to become a monk!

Today is a sort of harvest day. After two weeks of study, I believe my English speaking and thinking skills are much better than before. This progress is a good sign. I will continue to keep up the studying.
