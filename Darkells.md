I will try to record my daily study records in English
In the warm-up meeting, many people shared their own ways of learning English. This is a great start. The goal is to be able to communicate confidently in English after 21 days.

Today, I practiced my English in two ways.

-   **Speaking Practice**: I had a speaking session with Gemini about the topic of my hackathon project. I encountered some issues where my mispronunciations led to misunderstandings, and I had to repeatedly correct myself.
    
-   **Listening Practice**: I listened to a podcast about Ethereum's public goods infrastructure.
