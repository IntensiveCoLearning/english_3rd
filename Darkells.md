I will try to record my daily study records in English
In the warm-up meeting, many people shared their own ways of learning English. This is a great start. The goal is to be able to communicate confidently in English after 21 days.

Today, I practiced my English in two ways.

-   **Speaking Practice**: I had a speaking session with Gemini about the topic of my hackathon project. I encountered some issues where my mispronunciations led to misunderstandings, and I had to repeatedly correct myself.
    
-   **Listening Practice**: I listened to a podcast about Ethereum's public goods infrastructure.

I am searching for information on ZK Rollups today to confirm that generalized ZK Rollups are now available. Because I read a point that said general-purpose ZK Rollups haven't been achieved yet.

It is no longer true today. The technology has matured, and the vision of general-purpose ZK Rollups powered by zkEVMs is now a reality.

-   **Listening:** Listened to Fed Chair Powell’s speech at midnight. His familiar “Good afternoon” caused minor market fluctuations. Powell’s neutral tone avoided dovish or hawkish signals, emphasizing balanced monetary policy.
    
-   **Reading:** Studied IPFS and Arweave documentation for a hackathon project. Learned key terms like “content addressing” (IPFS) and “permaweb” (Arweave) for decentralized storage integration.
